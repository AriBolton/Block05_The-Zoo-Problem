                Bears are mammals that belong to the family Ursidae. They can be as small as four feet long and about 60 pounds (the sun bear) to as big as eight feet long and more than a thousand pounds (the polar bear). Theyâ€™re found throughout North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Below is a list of the bears who are currently residing in our zoo.

                <summary>
                    Alligators don't have sex-determining chromosomes, so the temperature at which they hatch determines their gender. The first 10 days of development are especially important.
                </summary>
                <p>
                    American alligators once faced extinction. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service placed them on the endangered species list in 1967. Fortunately, the legal protection worked. Just 20 years later, American alligators were taken off the list. Below is a list of the alligators who are currently residing in our zoo.
